# 4. Quickstart Guide For Action Creators

Creating **Actions** is easy.
In this section, we will

- understand how **CushyStudio** works,
- see how to create a custom deck
- see how to edit your cards
- see how to publish your deck on the library

## 4.1. How does `CushySudio` Work

1. On startup, **_CushyStudio_** connect to your **_ComfyUI_** server(s)

2. **CushyStudio** then scan you `ComfyUI` install and generates whole **_TypeScript SDK_** supporting all your custom nodes, assets, models instaleld, etc.

3. All your custom nodes, models, and images will be converted to `enums`, `classes`, `helpers`, etc, allowing you to create **Actions** with maximum type safety and completion. you can check the generated SDK at `schema/global.d.ts`.
    - üëâ this file is updated after each ComfyUI connection.
    - üëâ It means it will only be created after the first successful connection to your ComfyUI instance


## 4.2. What is an `Action` ?

An `Action` is a self  containing
- a widget definition ( `"ui"` function)
- an execution logic  ( `"run"` function)
  - the `"run"` function will receive the widget value when you click the `run` button


Here is a very simple card that print the value you enter


```ts
card({
    ui: (form) => ({ name: form.str({}) }),
    run: (runtime) => runtime.print('Hello World')
})
```



## 4.3. What is an `Action` ?

A `Deck` is a folder containing

  - a list of **Actions**
  - a list of `assets`
  - a list of `prefabs`
  - some `documentation` about how to use those cards
  - some `metadata` for proper library indexing.

Decks are made to be shared.

- You can download `Decks` from the `Library` panel
- You can publish `Decks` from the `Library` panel


##  4.4. Create your first deck

1. click the `[+ Create Deck]` button at the top of the `Library`

2. enter your `github username` and `deck name`
   1. üëâ your `github username` will be your dedicated namespace in the library
   2. üëâ all your decks will live under the `library/<username>/` folder

    ![](./docs/static/img/screenshots/2023-11-01-18-58-13.webp)

3. click `[OK]`

   1. it will create those files
      1.  `library/<username>/<deckname>/readme.md`
          - a readme file to explain what your deck is about
      2.  `library/<username>/<deckname>/cushy-deck.json`
          -  manifest that list all your cards for better library integration
      3.  `library/<username>/<deckname>/_prefab.ts`
          - a file where you can place your prefabs.
          - it contains some example prefabs for you to build uppon
          - file starts with an `_` so it's not listed in CushyStudio
      4.  `library/<username>/<deckname>/sample-card-1.ts`
          - first sample action
      5.  `library/<username>/<deckname>/sample-action-2.ts`
          - second sample action

    2.  it will also initialize a git
        1.  it will run `git init` in the created repository
        2.  it will run `git remote add origin "https://github.com/<username>/<deckname>`)
        3.  it will run `git remote add github "git@github.com:<username>/<deckname>.git`)
        - üëâ this is to make it easy to publish your deck to GitHub
        - üëâ you can also use any other git host, or none at all


4. Open the `sample-action-1.ts` card

 5. click the `[edit]` button to open the card in `vscode`
    - üëâ everything is preconfigure to run correctly in vscode and make you productive right away
    - üëâ fo this, you need to open the whole CushyStudio folder within vscode
    - üëâ (NOT just the action folder, NOR the action file itself)


```ts
card('demo1-basic', {
    author: 'rvion',
    ui: (form) => ({ positive: form.str({ label: 'Positive', default: 'flower' }), }),
    run: async (action, form) => {
        //  build a ComfyUI graph
        const graph = action.nodes
        const ckpt = graph.CheckpointLoaderSimple({ ckpt_name: 'albedobaseXL_v02.safetensors' })
        const seed = action.randomSeed()
        const sampler = graph.KSampler({
            seed: seed,
            steps: 20,
            cfg: 14,
            sampler_name: 'euler',
            scheduler: 'normal',
            denoise: 0.8,
            model: ckpt,
            positive: graph.CLIPTextEncode({ text: form.positive, clip: ckpt }),
            negative: graph.CLIPTextEncode({ text: '', clip: ckpt }),
            latent_image: graph.EmptyLatentImage({ width: 512, height: 512, batch_size: 1 }),
        })

        graph.SaveImage({
            images: graph.VAEDecode({ samples: sampler, vae: ckpt }),
            filename_prefix: 'ComfyUI',
        })

        // run the graph you built
        await action.PROMPT()
    },
})
```

<!-- 1. See how actions look like by dropping any **_ComfyUI_** `workflow` or `image` into the action and looking at the `converted.ts` -->

An `Card` is a file containing

-   An UI definition (widgets, form, styles, default values, tabs, etc...)
-   A piece of code that runs your action
-   ...And more


## 4.5. `Prefabs` so you don't repeat yourself

The simplest way to modularize your **Actions** is to build `prefabs`.

- `Prefabs` allow you to re-use parts of your cards in other cards.
- `Prefabs` allow you to re-use parts of your cards multiple times in your card
- `Prefabs` are functions that can add `widgets` (ui part) or `subgraphs` (execution part).
- `Prefabs` allow you to build complex cards very efficiently.

_Best practices:_

- Usually, your `Deck` will contain one or many `prefab` files,
- you can The main `prefab` used by the built-in `deck` here: `library/CushyStudio/default/_prefab.ts`:


### 4.5.1. prefabs are just functions.

- üëâ a `ui prefab` is a `function` that takes a `formBuilder` and returns a `Widget`.
- üëâ a `run prefab` is a function that takes a `runtime` and modify it's `graph` or perform other actions.
- üëâ a `util prefab` is an helper function that do whatever.

example:

```ts
// FILE: `_ui.ts`
import type { FormBuilder } from 'src/controls/FormBuilder'

// üìù this is a ui prefab you can use in any card you want.
export const ui_startImage = (form: FormBuilder) =>
    form.group({
        items: () => ({
            startImage: form.imageOpt({ group: 'latent' }),
            width: form.int({ default: 512, group: 'latent', step: 128, min: 128, max: 4096 }),
            height: form.int({ default: 512, group: 'latent', step: 128, min: 128, max: 4096 }),
            batchSize: form.int({ default: 1, group: 'latent', min: 1, max: 20 }),
        }),
    })
```

### 4.5.2. Naming Conventions



### 4.5.3. Use a UI Prefab

To use a `prefab` in your card, you can simply import it and use it.

![](./docs/static/img/screenshots/2023-11-01-18-27-38.webp)

- `ui  prefabs` are made to be used in the `ui` function of your card.
- `run prefabs` are made to be used in the `run` function of your card.
- `run prefabs` are made to be used in the `run` function of your card.




```ts
// FILE: `card1.ts`
import { ui_startImage } from './_ui'

card({
    name: 'card1',
    ui: (formBuilder) => {
        return {
            a: ui_startImage(formBuilder), // üëà HERE
            b: ui_startImage(formBuilder), // üëà HERE
            c: formBuilder.int({ default: 1 }),
        }
    },
    run: async (flow, p) => {
        flow.print(`startImage: ${p.a.startImage}`)
        flow.print(`startImage: ${p.b.startImage}`)
    },
})
```
### 4.5.4. Execution Prefab

The resulting card looks like this:

![](./docs/static/img/screenshots/2023-11-01-18-20-20.webp)



## 4.6. Various Function notations


**CushyStudio** aims to be accessible to non-programmers, while still being powerful enough for advanced users. You don't need to know typescript to get started, you can just learn what you need along the way.

This section is not a typescript tutorial, but rather a list of points of attention you may need to pay attention when building cards if you're not a typescript develloper.

Be careful to understand those various notations for functions


### 4.6.1. the special `() => ({ })` notation to return objects in a single line


```ts
const fn = () => ({ a: 1 })
//               üëÜ      üëÜ

```

This is equivalent to:

```ts
const fn = () => {
    return {a: 1}
}
```

or to

```ts
function fn() {
    return {a: 1}
}
```

## 4.7. Publish your Deck

Publishing your deck/cards is easy!

1. When creating a deck, **CushyStudio** automatically
   1. initialize the git repository for you.
   2. configure remote to point to the GitHub repository with the same name as your deck
      1.

2.  Create a GitHub repository. (https://github.com/new)

    ![](docs/static/img/screenshots/2023-10-18-23-15-11.png)

3.  Commit your deck files
    1.  you can one-click the `publish` button in your deck entry in the library
    2.  or youyou can follow instructions given by Git Hub on the new repository page

4.  Open an issue asking to add your `Deck` to the `Library`.
